# Boxever's JS Technical Evaluation

The technical test includes three parts:  
Part 1. A bug fix  
Part 2. A feature request  
Part 3. A short summary   


## Functional Overview

### Part 1: Bug Fix

A user has reported two bugs
  
Bug 1: On any of the booking steps, if I reload the browser, all of the details I've entered are gone!! 
I'm brought back to the first page!  

Bug 2: After I search for my flight, I'm brought to the search results page. 
If I navigate back to the search page, the date I've selected is empty or is today's date!


### Part 2: Feature Request
The booking process currently has 4 steps:  
Step 1: Search flight  
Step 2: Select flight  
Step 3: Enter Customer Details  
Step 4: Confirmation Screen  

We would like you to add a new step between 'Enter Customer Details' and 'Confirmation Screen'.   
The new step should offer a customer the opportunity to add extra bags and priority boarding for each passenger.

### Part 3: Summary 
Please provide a short summary of how you might improve the app from a technical point of view.  e.g.   
 Are there things you identified that could be improved in the application?  
 How did you feel about the choice of libraries and package managers?   
 How would you structure an application? Or modules in an application?   
 What would be your approach to ensuring the application was production ready? etc.
